    "Welcome to the interactive hands-on tutorial for [Devito](http://www.devitoproject.org). Devito is a domain-specific language (DSL) and code generation framework for the design of highly optimised finite difference kernels, and was primarily designed for use in seismic inversion methods. Devito utilises SymPy to allow the definition of matrix-free finite difference operators from high-level symbolic equations and generates optimised and automatically tuned code specific to a given target architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands-on tutorial is intended to give you an initial flavour of the Devito framework and the power of symbolic computation. We will demonstrate how quickly explicit finite difference operators can be created from only a few lines of Python code, and how we can use them to implement complex imaging algorithms in very little time (literally!).
